# Project 3: Tunbridge Farmers

A single-lane bridge connects the two Vermont villages of North Tunbridge and
South Tunbridge. Farmers in the two villages use this bridge to deliver their
produce to the neighboring town. The bridge can become deadlocked if both a
northbound and a southbound farmer get on the bridge at the same time (Vermont
farmers are stubborn and are unable to back up.) Using either Java semaphores or
Java synchronization, design an algorithm that prevents deadlock.
